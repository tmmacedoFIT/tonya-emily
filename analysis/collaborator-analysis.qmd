### Load libraries

```{r}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
library(here)
```

### Read in data
```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
lobster_traps <- read_csv(here::here("data/Lobster_Trap_Counts_All_Years_20210519.csv"))
```

### Explore data
```{r}
head(lobster_traps)
summary(lobster_traps)

```

### Convert missing to NA
```{r}
lobster_traps <- lobster_traps %>% 
    mutate(TRAPS = na_if(TRAPS, -99999))
summary(lobster_traps)
```

### Practice filter

Subset not at NAPL
```{r}
not_napl <- lobster_traps %>% 
  filter(SITE != "NAPL")
```

Subset at Carpenteria and number of traps is greater than 20
```{r}
carp_20_traps <- lobster_traps %>% 
  filter(SITE == "CARP" & "TRAPS" > 20)
```

### Question 4: find maximum floats and group by site and month
```{r}
max_traps <- lobster_traps %>% 
  group_by(SITE, MONTH) %>% 
  summarize(max_traps_col = max(TRAPS, na.rm = TRUE))
head(max_traps)
```
